<h3>WHO WE ARE?</h3>

<p>HHD is a process of shaping the experience of interior space, by subtle manipulation of spatial volume and surface treatment. There are several ways to style your home, office, retail, malls and work spaces.</p>

<p>However, the key to smart interior design is to draw on diverse aspects of environmental psychology, architecture, product design and purpose in addition to the elements of decoration and clubbing it with desire, aspiration and vision of the client to create spaces he loves to inhabit and draw positive energy from it.</p>

<p>It requires an element of passion, an eye for beauty and aesthetics, vivid imagination, knowledge and experience, updated information on new products, methods and applications that are constantly evolving in a highly dynamic building material industry. The ability of interior spaces to create positive changes in people&#39;s lives is prioritized at HHD.</p>

<p>We get to know our clients, their personalities and needs. This helps us define the scope of work and the direction that we should take with the project. We take all of the mystery, misconception and angst out of your hands. You benefit from our years of experience, knowhow and trade discounts.</p>

<h3>QUALITY OF LIFE</h3>

<p>In addition to the functional and aesthetic benefits derived from well designed spaces, interior design also contributes to quality of life and well being.</p>

<p>Several case studies illustrate the many ways in which interior design can be employed to address specific physical, psychological, social and economic needs, thus meeting both practical and strategic requirements of clients and occupants.</p>

<h3>SERVICES</h3>

<p><strong>DESIGN PRESENTATION</strong></p>

<p>Professionals at HHD study the architectural plans of the site and conceptualize the diverse themes and schemes that can transform the site as per the needs, wants and desires of the clients, documented and derived from the minutes of the preliminary meetings with them.</p>

<p>These concepts are then visualized through rendered graphics and the same is presented to the clients with rough estimates of costs.</p>

<p><strong>MATERIAL SELECTION</strong></p>

<p>Developments in the building industry have presented the users with a wide array of options under diverse budgetary benchmarks. HHD has an extensive databank of materials and their suppliers complete with specifications which is constantly updated. In close coordination with clients and vendors, material requirements are tabulated in terms of quantity, texture, colour, technical specifications, suppliers, price and delivery lead times. The tabulated information is applied in material requirement schedules.</p>

<p><strong>COST &amp; BUDGETING</strong></p>

<p>Detailed cost sheets are prepared from the information tabulated in previous exercise and matched with the budgetary constraints given by the clients.</p>

<p>If there are cost overruns then a special exercise is undertaken in re-negotiating deals, using cost effective substitutes etc., to fit the requirements within budget without compromising on scheduled material. In inevitable cases, the material requirements are modified to fit the budgetary constraints.</p>

<p><strong>APPOINT CONTRACTORS</strong></p>

<p>Over the years HHD has developed relations with quality contractors that specialize in implementation of designs. Working with such contractors over a period of time has resulted in improved levels of understanding in working styles and quality specifications.</p>

<p>HHD recommends the use of their approved contractors to clients. However, clients have the option of using their own contractors and HHD provides comprehensive guidance and supervision.</p>

<p><strong>PROJECT MANAGEMENT</strong></p>

<p>The ability to do a good design alone will not make one a good or successful designer. One has to be a good manager and most importantly, be a sensitive person. Thus a well organized individual task supervision clubbed with an overall project management procedure is built-in to HHD services.</p>

<p>This ensures quality implementation of the project and problems become foreseen events rather than surprises. Corrective actions can be taken in time to assure timely completion, thus curbing cost overruns and wastage.</p>
